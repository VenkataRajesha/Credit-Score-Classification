# Credit-Score-Classification
Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce manual efforts. 

The Aim:

The objective of this project is to explore the data to identify the pattern that causes the person to become a good or bad or standard type credit score and build a machine learning model that should be able to predict or classify the credit score type.

The procedures were taken to solve the problem:

1. Understanding the business problem and researching the features and understanding what they exactly are.
2. Basic checking of the data types and validating the data
3. Performing a thorough Exploratory Data analysis before modifying(preprocessing) the data.
4. Inferring the inference found in the EDA step.
5. Framing the hypothesis on the factors and deriving the conclusions.
6. Extensive pre-processing for Machine Learning model to build
7. Building the models from base models to Advanced Ensemble techniques.
8. Tuning the best-performed model and rebuilding the final model with the best hyperparameter
9. Business conclusions.
